# Project Week 4 Day 3 - Red Eye Photography

## Objectives

Red Eye Photography wants to make a portfolio website for their photography. [Here's what they want it to look like](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/red-eye/index.html).

#### Step 0

First, log in to [CODEPEN](http://codepen.io/) or sign up if haven't before. 

After you log in, click +New Pen button. 

Change the title to Red Eye Photography and then copy all the text in *index.html* and *style.css* to HTML and CSS section respectively in CODEPEN. 

Now you will work on CODEPEN, and don't forget to save.

#### Step 1

In the header, add text for a heading. We used Red Eye Photography.

Adjust the heading's margins and width so that it matches the [final result](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/red-eye/index.html).

#### Step 2

In the nav section, add a list containing four items:
* Home
* About
* Gallery
* Contact

Write CSS to display them on the same line.

#### Step 3

In the `container` section, there are two `<div class="row">...</div>` rows. Inside each row, use [Bootstrap's grid](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-example-basic) create three equal-sized columns.

#### Step 4

Inside each column, add an image. Feel free to use your own images.

Here are the ones we used: [one](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/red-eye-photography/p1.jpg), [two](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/red-eye-photography/p2.jpg), [three](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/red-eye-photography/p3.jpg), [four](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/red-eye-photography/p4.jpg), [five](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/red-eye-photography/p5.jpg), and [six](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/red-eye-photography/p6.jpg).

Use [Bootstrap's CSS class](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#images) `img-responsive` to style each image. Feel free to use your own images.

#### Step 5

Add a `footer` section with text for the copyright.

Write CSS to align as shown in the [final result](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/red-eye/index.html).
